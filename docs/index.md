# Django IP Access Middleware

Welcome to the documentation for **Django IP Access Middleware**.

This package provides **IP and hostname-based access control** for Django
applications. It supports:

- IP addresses and CIDR ranges stored in the database
- Hostname matching via environment variables
- Same-network detection for Kubernetes and private networks
- Route-based access control with regex, exact, startswith, and endswith patterns
- Mixins and decorators for opt-in protection of specific views

Use the navigation on the left to learn how to install, configure, and use the
middleware in your project.
